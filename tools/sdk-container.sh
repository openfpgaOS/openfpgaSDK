# Run an openfpgaOS-SDK app build (or any command) inside the containerized
# RISC-V toolchain.  Mirrors firmware-container.sh but for SDK app builds —
# the toolchain image is shared (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc + picolibc + musl
# headers + make + python3 + bsdmainutils).
#
# Why this exists: SDK app developers (and downstream cores reusing this
# SDK) shouldn't have to install a RISC-V toolchain by hand — particularly
# painful on macOS where Homebrew's `riscv64-elf-gcc` ships without a libc.
# `bash sdk-container.sh make <targets>` Just Works on any host with a
# container runtime (Docker, or Apple `container` on Apple silicon — see oci.sh).
#
# This script is mirrored to the openfpgaOS-SDK repo (and to any other core
# repo that does `make sdk DEST=<path>`) so SDK consumers get the same
# Docker-only build path without needing the openfpgaCore source.
#
# Usage:
#   bash sdk-container.sh make APP=foo SRCS="main.c"        # one-shot build
#   bash sdk-container.sh -C src/apps/myapp make            # build in subdir
#   bash sdk-container.sh bash                              # interactive shell
#
# Image is auto-built on first use.  Override the toolchain image with
# SDK_IMG=<tag>.  Override the Dockerfile location with SDK_DOCKERFILE=<path>.

# Discover the repo root that contains us.  When this script is shipped INSIDE
# the SDK repo (or a downstream core repo) it'll resolve to that repo's root;
# when invoked from openfpgaCore directly, it resolves to openfpgaCore.  Either
# way, that root is bind-mounted into the container at the same path so
# absolute paths in app Makefiles resolve identically inside.

# WORKDIR (cwd inside the container) is whatever the user was in on the
# host (or wherever -C took us) — feels like running make locally.
#
# HOME goes on a dedicated tmpfs at /sdkhome (not /tmp) to avoid shadowing
# repo bind-mounts whose host path happens to live under /tmp.
# Name the container + tear it down from a trap so Ctrl+C (SIGINT) cleanly
# kills the build instead of orphaning it.  When stdin is a TTY we pass -i -t
# (above) and docker forwards signals itself, but for redirected/piped runs
# the trap is what guarantees the container dies.  Run in the background and
# `wait` (interruptible) so the trap fires on INT/TERM/EXIT.
